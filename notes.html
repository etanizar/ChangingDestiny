	<p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;In the past, before the government employed someone, examinations were held for all the candidates. After passing the first entry examination, the students would then be sent to various county schools to study. (Once the system became standardized, tests were held every three years. In the fall, candidates were tested in their home prefectures. In the spring, those who passed went to the Ministry of Rites in the capital for the metropolitan examination, and, if they passed again, they were examined at the palace by the emperor. Those who passed all levels received the Jinshi degree, were given rank as civil officials, and were assigned to government posts.)

	<p><sup>4</sup>&nbsp;[The I-Ching is one of the <cite>Five Classics</cite> in Confucianism. It is now used as a manual of divination and has philosophical aspects. Trans]</p>

	<div id="05"></div>
	<p><sup>5</sup>&nbsp;At this time, Liaofan’s cousin had a friend who was teaching at someone’s home. Perhaps, this person was a wealthy individual who had empty rooms in his house that were used as classrooms and who employed teachers to give lessons to his children as well as those of relatives and friends. Liaofan became a pupil of Mr. Yu and began his preparation for the examination. In the past, schools were not common like they are today. Before the Qing dynasty, [1644-1912] lessons were conducted in home schools. Usually there was only one teacher giving lessons to twenty or thirty students. There were no high schools, only public universities. Students studied very hard with a private tutor to pass the examination before attending a government-managed university.</p>

	<div id="06"></div>
	<p><sup>6</sup>&nbsp;[A civil scholar was equivalent to a high school student and an imperial scholar was equivalent to a university student.]</p>

	<div id="07"></div>
	<p><sup>7</sup>&nbsp;At that time, the government provided high school and university students with an allowance and supplemented their living expenses with rice. Similar to a food ration, excess rice could be sold. As every region had a set number of openings, only when there was a vacancy could a person be added to the list.</p>

	<div id="08"></div>
	<p><sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Imperial students had all of their expenses paid by the government; however, the students were expected to work for the government upon completion of their schooling.</p>

	<div id="09"></div>
	<p><sup>9</sup>&nbsp;These are two of the <cite>Five Classics</cite> of Confucianism. The <cite>Book of Songs</cite> underscores the Confucian valuation of human feelings. The <cite>Book of History</cite> presents kingship in terms of the ethical foundation for a humane government. (Encyclopedia Britannica, Britannica Inc., Copyrighted 1999-2000)</p>

	<div id="11"></div>
	<p><sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Since ancient times in China, the <cite>Platform Sutra</cite>, the <cite>Diamond Sutra</cite>, and the <cite>Surangama Sutra</cite> have been acknowledged as eminent literary works. The <cite>Platform Sutra</cite> by Master Huineng should not be thought of as solely a sutra of the Zen school for it is an overview of Buddhism and is essentially Master Huineng’s report of what he had learned through his study and practice.</p>

	<p><sup>14</sup>&nbsp;[The first of the three serious offenses is failing to support our parents when they are alive. Second is failing to give them a decent burial upon their death. The third is the most critical - not producing an heir.]</p>

	<div id="15"></div>
	<p><sup>15</sup>&nbsp;[Buddha Amitabha is the Sanskrit name for the Buddha of the Western Pure Land. When we are chanting we use the Chinese pronunciation “Amituofo.” “Amituo” is a name meaning infinite life and infinite light, and “Fo” means Buddha.]</p>

	<div id="16"></div>
	<p><sup>16</sup>&nbsp;[Doing this plants the seed for future Buddhahood and in this way saves their life by rescuing them from suffering in the six paths of existence.]</p>

	<p><sup>18</sup>&nbsp;[The Bodhi mind is the great compassionate and sincere mind, with every thought to attain complete self-realization for self and others.]</p>

	<div id="19"></div>
	<p><sup>19</sup>&nbsp;Tai Jia was an emperor during the Shang dynasty [ca.1766-ca.1125 B.C.]. When he was young, he engaged in immoral activities. After listening to the guidance of the great sage Yiyin, he amended his wrong behavior. The above quote was his expression of gratitude to the sage.</p>

	<div id="20"></div>
	<p><sup>20</sup>&nbsp;[1368-1644]</p>

	<div id="21"></div>
	<p><sup>21</sup>&nbsp;[Master Lianchi was the eighth Patriarch of the Pure Land school and was Master Ou-Yi’s teacher.]</p>

	<div id="22"></div>
	<p><sup>22</sup>&nbsp;This method provides us with four benefits. First, we would not forget the Chinese language. This is especially important for those of Chinese descent living abroad as it would enable them to remember their origins. Second, we would be able to understand Chinese characters. Third, we would be well versed in classical Chinese, which would provide us with the ability to read Complete Works of the Four Treasuries. Passed down through five thousand years of Chinese history, these books contain the essence of the wisdom and experience of past sages and virtuous ancients. Fourth, we would be able to read Buddhist sutras that serve as the foundation for our practice.</p>

	<div id="23"></div>
	<p><sup>23</sup>&nbsp;[“Namo Amituofo” is Chinese and means “To pay homage to Buddha Amitabha.”]</p>

	<div id="24"></div>
	<p><sup>24</sup>&nbsp;It is the same in Buddhism. To show the utmost respect, a monk or nun is addressed by the name of his or her way place or location. Master Zhizhe was addressed as the great master of Tiantai because he lived on Tiantai Mountain. Another example is Master Kuiji who was called Cien because he was from the Cien Temple.</p>

	<div id="25"></div>
	<p><sup>25</sup>&nbsp;Although this is not a very high level of achievement, attainment of it showed that Liaofan was proceeding correctly and had received a good response.</p>

	<div id="26"></div>
	<p><sup>26</sup>&nbsp;[The third study is skills for making a living and the fourth is the arts.]</p>

	<div id="27"></div>
	<p><sup>27</sup>&nbsp;[Another of the <cite>Five Classics</cite> of Confucianism, the <cite>Book of Rites</cite> was concerned with principles of conduct.]</p>

	<div id="28"></div>
	<p><sup>28</sup>&nbsp;Everyday Liaofan handled public affairs and served as an interrogator in the judicial system. This is unlike today where the judicial and legislative departments are separated. In ancient China, the mayor managed judicial and legislative cases.</p>

	<div id="29"></div>
	<p><sup>29</sup>&nbsp;Buddhism flourished during the Ming and Qing dynasties, several centuries ago, when many monks and nuns lived on the four famous mountains. The ten thousand who lived on Wutai Mt. [symbolizing Manjusri Bodhisattva] was actually not a large number. The mountain with the most people was Putuo, [symbolizing Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva] with around thirty to forty thousand monks and nuns in residence. And there were over ten thousand living on Emei Mt. [symbolizing Samantabhadra Bodhisattva] and Jiouhua Mt. [symbolizing Ksitagarbha Bodhisattva].</p>

	<div id="30"></div>
	<p><sup>30</sup>&nbsp;[The <cite>Book of History</cite>, another of the <cite>Five Classics</cite> of Confucianism, is a collection of ancient historical documents.]</p>

	<div id="31"></div>
	<p><sup>31</sup>&nbsp;A time when China was undergoing much change.</p>

	<div id="32"></div>
	<p><sup>32</sup>&nbsp;The <cite>Spring and Autumn Annals</cite>, another of the <cite>Five Classics</cite>, is an historic account of the Lu Nation. Throughout his lifetime, Confucius edited and compiled these records into a book, which has been passed down to this day. This book has commentaries written by many people. The most popular and widely studied one has been extensively footnoted by Zuo Qiuming and is called the <cite>Spring and Autumn Annals</cite>. Two other editions are the Gongyang Commentary and the Guliang Commentary. By far, the Spring-Autumn Annals is the most accurate, best written, and footnoted. All three are in the Thirteen Ancient Chinese Scriptures.</p>

	<div id="33"></div>
	<p><sup>33</sup>&nbsp;[Ganzhu Living Buddha was a student of Zhangjia Living Buddha.]</p>

	<div id="34"></div>
	<p><sup>34</sup>&nbsp;[Dan Zhougong lived during the Zhou dynasty and is remembered as an outstanding regent. He is considered a role model for good politicians. Yiyin was a famous minister who helped Emperor Zhou Chengwang to overthrow the tyrannical Xia reign.]</p>

	<div id="35"></div>
	<p><sup>35</sup>&nbsp;[The five abilities are clairvoyance, clairaudience, knowing one’s own past lifetimes, physical abilities, and knowing the minds of others.]</p> 

	<div id="36"></div>	
	<p><sup>36</sup>&nbsp;36 In the past, it was a Chinese custom for a man to always leave his hat on, even at the time of death. To do otherwise would have been a disgrace.</p>

	<div id="37"></div>
	<p><sup>37</sup>&nbsp;[Five Deadly Offenses are patricide, matricide, to intentionally cause a Buddha to bleed, to kill a Bodhisattva or an Arhat, and to disrupt the Sangha’s unity. Ten Bad Conducts are to kill, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, use abusive language, bear tales, use enticing words, have greed, anger, and ignorance. ]</p>

	<div id="38"></div>
	<p><sup>38</sup>&nbsp;Thus, main halls in Buddhist temples are called the Hall of Great Heroes.</p>

	<div id="39"></div>
	<p><sup>39</sup>&nbsp;[Emperor Shun was a highly respected emperor who lived over four thousand years ago.]</p>

	<div id="40"></div>
	<p><sup>40</sup>&nbsp;[In other words, as good thoughts arise, bad thoughts are replaced.]</p>

	<div id="41"></div>
	<p><sup>41</sup>&nbsp;[Master Yuanying was a Zen master who, after a lifetime of specializing in the <cite>Surangama Sutra</cite>, recommended the Pure Land method. Master Baojing was a Tiantai master and was the student of Master Dixian.]</p>

	<div id="42"></div>
	<p><sup>42</sup>&nbsp;[Upon marriage, the husband’s family would give a dowry to the family of the future bride. Families who did not know better often accepted an offer of marriage from the wealthiest family.]</p>

	<div id="43"></div>
	<p><sup>43</sup>&nbsp;[Regardless of where are past ancestors are currently, if we are truly filial, then our good deeds can bring them honor and respect from other beings and will thus benefit them even if they are living in one of the Three Bad Realms. Therefore, when we make offerings to them, they will accept what we have done.]</p>

	<div id="44"></div>
	<p><sup>44</sup>&nbsp;Liaofan’s examples were only a few decades apart and were familiar to everyone of his time. He used them to encourage the practice and accumulation of goodness for these will result in good rewards.</p>

	<div id="45"></div>
	<p><sup>45</sup>&nbsp;When I was young, I lived in Jianou for six years and often went with my schoolmates to play in what had formerly been Yang Rong’s house. It was of an ancient style filled with many antiques and had two stone lions on either side of the front door. Lanterns were also hung in front of the door, similar to those outside of a temple.</p>

	<div id="46"></div>
	<p><sup>46</sup>&nbsp;The family could not have earned much money. It was an accepted practice in Fujian to not charge a set fee. Students did not even need to pay. But even when passengers did not have any money, they still would be carried across the river. A small container was placed on one side of the boat, and people who had money, put in whatever amount they wished.</p>

	<div id="47"></div>
	<p><sup>47</sup>&nbsp;At the time of this incident, the county magistrate also handled judicial matters and served as the judge.</p>

	<div id="48"></div>
	<p><sup>48</sup>&nbsp;[In the Chinese culture, a prosperous family is one that has many male descendants who are virtuous and who are successful in their work. Many descendants are crucial because then there will be people to practice goodness and to bring honor to their ancestors.]</p>

	<div id="49"></div>
	<p><sup>49</sup>&nbsp;At the time, government officials in lower positions received a small salary and many of them retired in a state of near impoverishment. If an official retired with a good amount of money, it was highly likely that he had taken bribes or embezzled during his term of office. Where else could the money have come from? Scholars were not taught how to run a business. If one became a high-ranking official and contributed greatly to the country, then he could receive rewards in the form of farmlands and houses.</p>

	<div id="50"></div>
	<p><sup>50</sup>&nbsp;Zicheng’s two sons were both in the Department of Civil Personnel. Their ranks were similar to a vice-minister. Usually, there was one minister and two vice-ministers, one for administrative matters and the other for general matters. Both of the grandsons were well known for doing a good job. A current descendant, Mr. Yang Chuting, also held a government position and was known for his honesty and fairness.</p>

	<div id="51"></div>
	<p><sup>51</sup>&nbsp;Common sense is needed when treating a person with hypothermia. Northerners are familiar with the procedure; however, southerners are generally not. In such a case, use a towel soaked in cold water to gently rub the body in order to let the cold slowly seep out of the pores.</p>

	<div id="52"></div>
	<p><sup>52</sup>&nbsp;[The Zhou dynasty that had seen the golden age of Chinese philosophy, lasted almost eight hundred years and collapsed in 256 B.C.]</p>

	<div id="53"></div>
	<p><sup>53</sup>&nbsp;There are several books, which tell of such accounts, such as Notes from Yuewei Chamber by Ji Xiaolan, Spiritual Collections by Pu Sungling, Twenty-five Books of Official Records, and A Record of Response and Retribution in History, from the first year of the Republic of China. These all provide numerous examples of the law of causality.</p>

	<div id="54"></div>
	<p><sup>54</sup>&nbsp;At the time, wealthy people who owned all of the land rented it to the farmers. Most of the farmers would be able to survive a bad year as long as they did not have to pay the rent.</p>

	<div id="55"></div>
	<p><sup>55</sup>&nbsp;Trials usually began at the break of dawn. The atmosphere in the dark courtroom was extremely frightening, like being held for judgment in hell before the king of the underworld. Mr. Tu worked in the judiciary department that is similar to today’s Supreme Court. His position, roughly equivalent to that of section chief, was not high.</p>

	<div id="56"></div>
	<p><sup>56</sup>&nbsp;Since the emperor resided in the imperial city, it was the best governed and the model for the rest of the country. Mr. Tu understood that if it had unjustly sentenced prisoners, then there must be many more such cases outside the city.</p>

	<div id="57"></div>
	<p><sup>57</sup>&nbsp;Master Zhongfeng lived during the Yuan dynasty. [1280-1368.] His name may be familiar to some of us because he edited the Thrice Yearning Ceremony Book that we use in our practice.</p>

	<div id="58"></div>
	<p><sup>58</sup>&nbsp;The pure land of each Buddha-land is manifested from the true nature. But, if we possess just one longing, then this is no longer a reflection of the true nature.</p>

	<div id="59"></div>
	<p><sup>59</sup>&nbsp;We can see an example of this in the Ksitigarbha Sutra where the Brahman girl called “Bright Eyes” made a vow on behalf of her mother.</p>

	<div id="60"></div>
	<p><sup>60</sup>&nbsp;During ancient times in China, students used to give their teacher small gifts during holidays. Originally, the gifts were strips of dried meat tied into a bundle. Later, the gifts varied and may not necessarily have been dried meat. Teachers taught at home schools and the number of students varied. Twenty to thirty was a good size while the smaller schools might have had only a dozen or so students, in which case the teacher would receive a meager amount of gifts.</p>

	<div id="61"></div>
	<p><sup>61</sup>&nbsp;During ancient times, it was an acceptable custom for a man who had no sons to take a second wife to bear him an heir to carry on the family line.</p>

	<div id="62"></div>
	<p><sup>62</sup>&nbsp;In ancient times, when such objects were often used as tokens of a promise, the most preferred shape was round and flat with a circular hole in the middle. This was called a bi while others were called guei and zhang, with the size of a guei generally being larger than a zhang. They were used as reminders of something important to be done. Several of these jade objects from different dynasties can be found in the National Palace Museum in Taiwan and have extremely high historical value.</p>

	<div id="63"></div>
	<p><sup>63</sup>&nbsp;In ancient China, a person who recommended a highly valuable individual to the emperor would be rewarded. Why? Because whenever this person contributed to the country and created benefits for others, it was all because of another’s recommendation. The good deeds that have been done by this person are the same as the person who recommended him. Therefore, in ancient China, people often recommended those who were good, filial, honest, and talented to the imperial palace so that true talent could be cultivated.</p>

	<div id="64"></div>
	<p><sup>64</sup>&nbsp;Mara is the representation of all that is evil, a malevolent being who tries to prevent us from doing good or achieving attainment in our practice.</p>

	<div id="65"></div>
	<p><sup>65</sup>&nbsp;This is especially true during a war when we may be forced to suffer overwhelming losses such as that of our homes. In such situations, as we drift from one place to another, we have no idea of what is going to happen next. Therefore, since the age of ten, all the children in my family were taught to be independent and to take care of ourselves in the event we were separated from our family. Also, we were taught how to survive alone in the woods.</p>

	<div id="66"></div>
	<p><sup>66</sup>&nbsp;[Laozi, ca.570-ca.490 B.C., is considered the founder of Taoism, a belief system that seeks complete harmony with nature. Taoism teaches us to abandon all struggling and to seek utter simplicity through matters of culture, nature, and mysticism. Zhuangzi, ca.369-ca.286 B.C., was a philosopher who was of great importance to Taoism.]</p>

	<div id="67"></div>
	<p><sup>67</sup>&nbsp;Therefore, Buddhists would do well to read the <cite>Four Books</cite>. Truthfully speaking, we can only give rise to the heart that loves the country and its people, if we have completely read the <cite>Four Books</cite> and understand China’s historical culture. Today, the Chinese have forgotten about the country and its people due to poor planning of the educational system.</p>

	<div id="68"></div>
	<p><sup>68</sup>&nbsp;The heart and roots of Chinese culture lie in ancestral memorial halls and the classical Chinese language. The reason China became a country with so much cultural history that extends over thousands of years is due to the strong foundation of the normal human relationships in the Chinese ethical tradition. Classical Chinese must be preserved because without it, the Chinese people will suffer horrendous adversities, and the race can never be restored. Also, we must preserve the Mahayana teachings. As long as we can preserve these three things, then not only will our country and culture have a bright future, but the world will also benefit.</p>

	<div id="69"></div>
	<p><sup>69</sup>&nbsp;In the past, books were not privately owned so writing in them was forbidden. They were carefully passed down for generations. Anyone who wished an individual copy would hand copy one. The books were cherished, respected, and protected. If any of these ancient texts were damaged, they would be mended, copied, and distributed, so they would not be lost. This was the greatest merit.</p>

	<div id="70"></div>
	<p><sup>70</sup>&nbsp;This tradition is still practiced today in Theravada Buddhism. At the time that Buddhism was introduced into China, it was considered the most civilized country in the world. But things have changed and in regards to proper behavior, the Chinese are far behind others because their education has failed.</p>
