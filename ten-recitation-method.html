	<h2>The Ten-Recitation Method</h2>

	<p>This simple, convenient, and effective way to practice Buddha name chanting is especially suitable for those who find that they have little time for cultivation. The chanting helps us to be mindful of Amitabha Buddha. It brings us joy.</p>
	<p>We begin when we wake up. Sit up straight and clearly chant “Amituofo” ten times with a calm and focused mind, aloud or silently. We repeat this eight more times during the day, each time chanting “Amituofo” ten times. This chanting can be done by following one of two programs. Please choose the one that is the most suitable for your circumstances.</p>

	<div style="text-align:center">
		<br />One program is to chant upon waking up,
		<br />before and after breakfast, 
		<br />before work 
		<br />before and after lunch, 
		<br />before and after dinner, 
		<br />and before retiring. 
	</div>

	<div style="text-align:center">
		<br />The other program is to chant upon waking up, 
		<br />before breakfast, 
		<br />before and after our morning’s work, 
		<br />before lunch, 
		<br />before and after our afternoon’s work, 
		<br />before dinner, 
		<br />and before retiring. 
	</div>

	<p>The key is regularity; disruption of this practice will reduce its effectiveness. When we recite consistently without interruption, we will soon feel an increase in our wisdom, serenity, and purity of mind. Diligent practice of this method together with unwavering belief, vows, and living a moral life can ensure fulfillment of our wish to reach the Western Pure Land.</p>
